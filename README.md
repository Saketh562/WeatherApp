# Weather App

This is a simple weather application that allows users to view their current weather and search for weather information by city. The app fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and displays information like temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness.

## Features

- **Search Weather:** Allows users to search for weather details of any city worldwide.
- **Real-time Data:** Displays temperature, weather description, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness.
- **Clean UI:** A responsive and simple user interface with smooth tab transitions.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Structure of the application.
- **CSS3:** Styling and layout with a modern, responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Application logic and API integration.
- **OpenWeather API:** Fetching real-time weather data.
